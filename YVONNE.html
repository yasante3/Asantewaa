        <h1> YVONNE ASANTE</h1>
        <P1>Im in the person of Asante Yvonne.Kumasi Anglican Senior High is my alma mater so im a disciple.I'm nineteen years old.Im a biomedical engineering student in BME1.I chose biomedical engineering among all the courses because it is a combination of medical knowledge and engineering principles.It deals much with designing instruments for surgical procedures.I see it to be a training ground where life savers are raised and brought up.its quiet demanding.it is a jealous sister beacause it really needs much attention and commitment.The part i like is it helps u to explore ideas ,it promotes your thinking ability since at the end of the day u are to bring up something more presentable and convincing enough for use.its also a business platform where we communicate our ideas and what we have created,it be artificial organs or surgical instruments.I like courses that challenges my thinking ability.The part that makes me love it is the praticality aspect.</P1>
